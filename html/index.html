                <h2>WHAT IS EXERCISE</h2>
                <p>
                    Exercise is defined as any movement that makes your muscles
                    work and requires your body to burn calories. There are many
                    types of physical activity, including swimming, running,
                    jogging, walking, and dancing, to name a few. Being active
                    has been shown to have many health benefits, both physically
                    and <strong>mentally</strong>

                <p>BENEFITS OF EXERCISE</p>
                <h2><li>Exercise controls weight</li></h2>
                Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain
                weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn
                calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you
                burn. Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you
                can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any
                amount of activity is better than none at all. To reap the
                benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day â€”
                take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household
                chores. Consistency is key.
                <h2>
                    <li>Exercise combats health conditions and diseases:</li>
                </h2>
                Worried about heart disease? Hoping to prevent high blood
                pressure? No matter what your current weight is, being active
                boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the "good"
                cholesterol, and it decreases unhealthy triglycerides. This
                one-two punch keeps your blood flowing smoothly, which decreases
                your risk of cardiovascular diseases. Regular exercise helps
                prevent or manage many health problems and concerns, including:
                Stroke, Metabolic syndrome,High blood pressure,Type 2
                diabetes,Depression,Anxiety,Many types of cancer, Arthritis,
                Falls
                <h2><li>Exercise improves mood:</li></h2>
                Need an emotional lift? Or need to destress after a stressful
                day? A gym session or brisk walk can help. Physical activity
                stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling
                happier, more relaxed and less anxious. You may also feel better
                about your appearance and yourself when you exercise regularly,
                which can boost your confidence and improve your self-esteem.
                <h2><li>Exercise boosts energy:</li></h2>
                Winded by grocery shopping or household chores? Regular physical
                activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your
                endurance.Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues
                and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And
                when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to
                tackle daily chores.
                <h2><li>Exercise promotes better sleep:</li></h2>
                Struggling to snooze? Regular physical activity can help you
                fall asleep faster, get better sleep and deepen your sleep. Just
                don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized
                to go to sleep.

                    Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do your exercise:
                </h2>

                    <h3><li>WALKING</li></h3>
                    <p>
                        Walking is simple, free and one of the easiest ways to
                        get more active, lose weight and become healthier.
                        Sometimes overlooked as a form of exercise, walking
                        briskly can help you build stamina, burn excess calories
                        and make your heart healthier. You do not have to walk
                        for hours.
                        <em>"HEY jack lets's go for a walk downtown,"</em>
                        <em>"MOM i had like to go for a walk with now please."</em>
                    </p>
                    <h3><li>TAKE THE STAIRS</li></h3>
                    <p>
                        Stair climbing requires about 8 - 11kcal of energy per
                        minute, which is high compared to other moderate level
                        physical activities. Active stair climbers are more fit
                        and have a higher aerobic capacity. Even two flights of
                        stairs climbed per day can lead to 6 lbs of weight loss
                        over one year.You don't always need a gym to stay fit.
                        ...
                    </p>
                    <h3><li>BODY WEIGHT EXERCISE</li></h3>
                    <p>
                        The biggest gains were in aerobic capacity, with a 33%
                        improvement. Muscle endurance, particularly in the core,
                        increased by 11%, while lower-body power posted a 6%
                        gain. Even flexibility was better after the training
                    </p>

                    For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human
                    Services recommends these exercise guidelines: Aerobic
                    activity. Get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic
                    activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week,
                    or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity.
